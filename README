# News about China in German *Mirror*

### German Title: China berichte in *DER SPIEGEL*

- This is the final project of my Bachelor of Arts in German, which brought me the **Award of Outstanding Final Project in HUST**.
- I combined German and Technology of  Web Crawling, Data Analysis and NLP in the project.
- This Project mainly focuses on crawling all News about China from [Website of German Mirror](https://www.spiegel.de/)  by using `scrapy`, then making data analysis with many modules such as `pandas`,`spacy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `wordcloud`. This project uses `MongoDB` as database and has published the final datasets on Kaggle. ([kaggle datasets link](https://www.kaggle.com/markusjj/chinaberichte-in-der-spiegel-19472020))
